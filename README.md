# MacOutlookAutoSig
Auto Signature using Applescript for Outlook 2016


This script clears out an email signature of the same name on your client.  

Then the script calls a web service for quote of the day and builds your email signature. 

The email sig is set to the default.


You will need JSONHELPER added to your machine as well as access for your mac to run scripts.
